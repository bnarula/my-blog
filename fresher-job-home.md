My name is **Bhavya Narula** and I am here for your help.
I am now working in a well known Software Development company in Bengaluru, India.

### But back in 2013,
This is how I was:
- no campus placement
- no college brand name
- only 60% aggregate in BTech

### 2021 !!
I take atleast 2 interviews a week to help our recruitment team **hire** good Software Developers.

### The demand of Software Engineers is at all-time high. Software has been that field that came to further boom as the world got hit by the Coronavirus.

If you are about to start your career in IT in India, but haven't been able to get hired on campus placements, reach out to me.
