# Layoffs, time to lay low
Here's my take on the current Layoffs situation in the IT Services Industry in India. While it has been a concern for many professionals in this industry, I've observed that currently there are more instances of salary hikes being put on hold or reductions in salaries for freshers, rather than blatant layoffs. On the other hand, there have been some reports of some generous salary hikes, but sources of these news may not be accurate.

Overall, this is a good time to
- Recheck your priorities or your interests.
- Invest in learnings now and hold on tight, these times are cyclical. Nothing is permanent.
